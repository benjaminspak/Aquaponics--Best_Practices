# Aquaponics--Best_Practices

- Let water sit for 24 hours before putting in fish.
- Use goldfish to help keep down mosquito breeding.
- Tilapia fish prefer temp ~ 80F.
- Catfish is one of the most temp hearty fish.
- Use a screen to catch the solid waste from the fishwater outflow.
- Use `Organic Digester` to help speed up the biome of bateria that break down the fish solids in your grow medium.
- Buy fish pellets in bulk to save $$$.
- Use a bag of oyster shells in the fish tank to help balance the water's PH levels.
- Use `rock dust minerals` to help the yield.
- Use a `bell syphon valve` to drain the plant bed quicker. It will help prevent over-saturation and root rot.

## Recommended Grow

- Water crest.
- Kale.
- Lettuce. Do not put in full sun.
- Green / Purple Malabar spinach. Perennial - will continuously produce. Will not have to replant.
